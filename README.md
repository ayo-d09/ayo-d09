# Hi, I'm Ayomide 👋

I’m an aspiring **DevOps / Cloud Engineer** building strong fundamentals through hands-on, real-world practice.

I focus on understanding how systems work end-to-end by building, breaking, fixing, and documenting them — the same way issues show up in production.


## 🛠 What I’m Practicing

- Linux system administration  
- Bash scripting and automation  
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, TCP/IP, HTTP)  
- Git and GitHub workflows  
- Core DevOps concepts (CI/CD, monitoring basics)


## 🧩 How I Learn

- Build small but practical projects  
- Intentionally break things and debug failures  
- Document fixes and lessons learned  
- Recreate common DevOps scenarios


## 🎯 Current Focus

- Writing **reliable, production-style Bash scripts**
- Understanding **how services communicate over networks**
- Preparing for **entry-level DevOps / Cloud roles**


## 🚀 Goals

- Become a job-ready DevOps Engineer  
- Contribute to open-source projects  
- Keep improving through consistent hands-on work


## 📁 About This Repository

This repository is a collection of:
- Automation and system administration scripts  
- Linux and networking practice exercises  
- DevOps experiments and learning notes  
- Mini-projects inspired by real production tasks  

Each project includes documentation explaining **what it does**, **why it exists**, and **what I learned**.
